  <div class="story">
      <p>I am a student at Lambda School studying Full Stack Web Development. This journey began for me in July of 2019 and every day I am apppreciative of the way I am continously challenged and presented with the opportunity to flex my mental muscles. I find myself ridiculously excited by the game of figuring out what the problem is and how to fix it. Admittedly, it is usually a missing curly bracket or semi-colon, but I find great satisfaction in discovering it.</p>
      <p>As cliche as it may be, my husband is my inspiration for completly rehauling my professional life. Seeing him come home from a career he derives satisfaction from showed me that loving what you do is not just a fairy tale.</p>
